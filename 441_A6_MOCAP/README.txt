This is a Visual Studio 2005 project. 
If you get errors like "FL/gl.h not found", then set the include path to fltk correctly:
select key_frame1, then Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories -> navigate to the fltk project.


Once the program is running, follow these steps:

1. Load an actor using the Load Actor button.
2. Load a motion using the Load Motion button.
3. Start capturing keyframes using the Keyframe button. (I recommend capturing the starting position before you hit play). These Frames will be displayed in BLUE
4. Once the motion is complete, you should see all the keyframes you captured in BLUE as well as the final position of the originally loaded motion in YELLOW.
5. Hit the Interpolate button and you will see the motion restart. The interpolated motion generated by the keyframes is displayed in GREEN.
6. Compare the keyframes, interpolated motion, and original motion and note the accuracy.
