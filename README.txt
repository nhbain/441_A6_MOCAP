This is a Visual Studio 2005 project. 
If you get errors like "FL/gl.h not found", then set the include path to fltk correctly:
select key_frame1, then Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories -> navigate to the fltk project.

Steps to open the program:
1. Open key_frame1.dsw in visual studio
2. Right click key_frame1 in the solution explorer and set it as the startup project.
3. Right click key_frame1 and go to properties
4. Select C/C++ on the lefthand side and then select the "Program Database (/Zi) option in the "Debug Information Format" option.


Once the program is running, follow these steps:

1. Load an actor using the Load Actor button.
2. Load a motion using the Load Motion button.
3. Start capturing keyframes using the Keyframe button. (I recommend capturing the starting position before you hit play). These Frames will be displayed in BLUE
4. Once the motion is complete, you should see all the keyframes you captured in BLUE as well as the final position of the originally loaded motion in YELLOW.
5. Hit the Interpolate button and you will see the motion restart. The interpolated motion generated by the keyframes is displayed in GREEN.
6. Compare the keyframes, interpolated motion, and original motion and note the accuracy.

NOTE: If program crashes, you may have selected too many keyframes. Try again with a couple less. Enjoy!
